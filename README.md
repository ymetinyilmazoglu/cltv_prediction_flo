## What is CLTV ?
CLTV tells you how valuable a customer is to your brand and gives you an idea of ​​their overall value. It helps you understand how much you need to invest to retain this customer. Not only that, customer lifetime value also gives you insight into whether any given customer will convert into a repeat customer. The higher the customer lifetime value, the higher the brand loyalty and purchasing behavior. If this value is low, it is probably a passive customer who makes a one-time purchase and is harder to retain.
